### Theme Switching

## Customization

### Adding New Projects
Edit `/src/data/portfolio.json` and add new project objects:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Project Name",
  "description": "Short description",
  "longDescription": "Detailed description for project pages",
  "technologies": ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/username/project",
  "liveUrl": "https://project-demo.com",
  "featured": true
}
```

### Updating Personal Information
Modify the `personalInfo` section in the JSON file:

```json
{
  "personalInfo": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your Title",
    "bio": "Your bio description",
    "location": "Your Location",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
  }
}
```

### Color Customization
Each theme uses Tailwind CSS classes. You can customize colors by:
1. Editing the theme components in `/src/themes/`
