      longDescription: 'ChatFight is my first official game that I released on Steam. It is a game for Twitch streamers, to help them interact with their chat. The idea comes from a game called Marbles On Stream, in which viewers in chat get to put their name on a marble and hope that their marble reaches the finish line first. \n\nThe game is a Battle Royale, but for stream viewers. The viewers can customize their characters using the website by linking their Twitch account and equipping items. \n\nThere is also a store on the website where viewers can buy different items for their characters, as well as equipping gloves and boots. This game is still running and people are playing it daily, with over 200k total players since its launch.',

      description: 'A Value-Study Tool for Artists',
      longDescription: 'I created this tool to help with one of the most challenging aspects of learning to draw and paint: understanding value relationships. When working from reference photos, it can be difficult to identify the distinct light and dark patterns that give subjects their form and depth, especially when colors and fine details are distracting. This tool uses a GLSL shader to separate images into customizable value levels so you can clearly see the underlying structure of light and shadow. \n\nIt allows you to adjust the thresholds between levels and assign colors to different values to experiment with color schemes before starting a painting. It\'s essentially a training tool that helps develop the ability to see and simplify complex lighting into the clear value patterns that make artwork feel three-dimensional and visually compelling.',

      longDescription: 'This was one of my favorite projects that I have gotten to work on. I got to work on this project with two great friends, both of whom did an incredible job on their respective parts. I worked on the overall mood and gameplay mechanics, John did the level design and created the [SPOILER] which is way too good at what it is supposed to do, and Tyler did an absolutely amazing job with the music and sound design. If you have some extra time, just sit and enjoy the main menu music. And the sounds in-game are the perfect level of spooky to fit the mood.\n\nIf I were to work on this game again, I would definitely focus more on optimizing it. There were way too many trees on the level which cut down heavily on the performance, but it was a rushed game jam game so I was more focused on other aspects of the game. Overall, it was an amazing weekend and I hope you will enjoy the game!\n\nP.S. The game only takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. And if you want to speed run it, try the Konami Code. But I would try to beat it normally first to fully experience it.',
